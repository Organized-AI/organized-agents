## 🛠️ Agent-Specific Instructions

### **For Content Creation Agents**
1. **Week Content Template**: Each week must include:
   - `README.md` with objectives and overview
   - `TUTORIAL.md` with step-by-step instructions  
   - `examples/` directory with working code
   - `exercises/` directory with practice tasks
   - `SOLUTION.md` with exercise solutions
   - `ASSESSMENT.md` with evaluation criteria

2. **Code Quality Standards**:
   - All code must be executable and tested
   - Include error handling and edge cases
   - Provide multiple implementation approaches
   - Add comprehensive comments and documentation

3. **Learning Design Principles**:
   - Start with "Why" before "How"
   - Include real-world analogies
   - Provide multiple difficulty levels
   - Add visual diagrams where helpful

### **For Technical Implementation Agents**
1. **Agent Templates**: Create reusable templates for each of the 14 agents:

   - Connection Agent
   - Debug Agent
   - Documentation Agent
   - Review Agent
   - Research Agent
   - Architecture Agent
   - Build Agent
   - Deploy Agent
   - Monitor Agent

2. **Platform Support**: Ensure compatibility with:
   - OpenAI GPT models
   - Anthropic Claude models
   - Local LLMs (Ollama, etc.)
   - Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   - Local development environments

### **For Documentation Agents**
1. **User Experience Focus**:
   - Clear navigation between sections
   - Consistent formatting and styling
   - Quick reference guides
